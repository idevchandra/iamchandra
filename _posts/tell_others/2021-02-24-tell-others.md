My dad wouldn't agree with the first part of this quote... "Don't tell people your plans. Show them your results".

He says, "if you are in a position that you can't tell your plans to others, what kind of people you are really with?" There was a pause and silence. And, I was about to say something. He continued saying...

> "If I were you, I would tell my plans to my relatives and friends..."

"...I told them when I was about to do M.A. <br>
I told them when I was about to do M.Phil.<br>
I told them when I about to pursue my Ph.D.
<br>
When I told them, they were happy. They wished me the best! And, I did complete them all. I even got Gold Medal for my Ph.D. 
<br><br>
And you may ask me why I told...

... I told others because our inspiration and persistance might not be same at all times because of situations or whatever. You would definitely be trying hard to pursue your dreams. But, if you tell others and if you happen to meet them again, they would ask how are our projects/study/book-writing/etc. going on. That keeps reminding us about our dreams. No one has to. But you know they were concerned about us. If they happen to ask, then they are wellwishers. Also, if you are stuck at something, they might help you. <br><br>People achieve great results when they are together. I do not understand this hiding and revealing the results in grand manner. It might hurt them that all these days you were hiding it. Why to even hide it? This might spoil the relationship that we have witht them. We don't tell our plans because we are afraid of embarrassment in case of failure. I was not afraid of failure. So, I told them. Or, we are afraid that some forces (chuckle) would stop our efforts, or someone would spoil your plans. No body can spoil your plans if you are determined. <br>
<br>
Also, good people want to be with the people having goals, plans and who pursue them. Like minded good people work together. They inspire each other. Be with right people. Inspire them. And, get inspiration from them."

> And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. - Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

Well, that's also what my dad is, an open book.
