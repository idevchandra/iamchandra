                “Tyagaraja Aaraadhanaa Utsavaalu” (Telugu: త్యాగరాజ ఆరాధనా ఉత్సవాలు, Tyagaraja commemorative music festival) were going on in Nellore as conducted by “Tyagaraja Gaana Sabha” (Telugu: త్యాగరాజ గాన సభ) in the year of 2000. There, for the first time, I had great chance of witnessing prodigy of Prasanna, playing Carnatic Music on guitar.

                I came across this post on TechCrunch. A kickstarter project, building a “perfect” moon for living room. The making of “this” moon is intriguing.
